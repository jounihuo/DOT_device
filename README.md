This contains the Python code for reading and processing spectrometer data from a self-made measurement device.
Spectral measurements are used with diffuse optical tomography theory to reconstruct image from the data. 
Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) and Conjugate Gradient Least Squares (CGLS) algorithms are used.
